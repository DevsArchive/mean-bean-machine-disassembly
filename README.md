# Dr. Robotnik's Mean Bean Machine Disassembly

I haven't worked on this for a good while now. Maybe someone will find use in this. Bit-perfect ROM is buildable. Code is fully disassembled and most data is split out (exception being sound data). Documentation is nowhere near complete, however.

It's very well possible that some labels are inaccurate, so keep that in mind.
